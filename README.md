# CanSat-workshop
A Can-Sat is a small-scale satellite model resembling a cylindrical can in shape. It serves as an educational tool, allowing students to replicate major satellite subsystems like power, sensors, communication, and onboard computers (OBC). This hands-on workshop will provide participants the opportunity to create a small scale satellite which mimics a real satellite.
